Planr is a full-stack web application build during a "build week" by Lambda School students. Planr provides a web application that allows a user to create/save events in their profile as well as add various details about the event. Once a user adds an event, they are able to manage shopping list items and track the cost of those items against an allotted event budget.

### Style Guide for development

- 2 spaces for indentation for JS and CSS (Prettier extension)
- Components should be written in PascalCase.
- Functional components will be written by default. If state is required, use use React hooks instead of writing class components. Because the app's component tree hierarchy isn't overly complex, manage state without Redux or useReducer in order to focus on building app features. Props will either be passed down from parent to child as normal or with the help of the Context API.
